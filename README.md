Crystals Collector
- This app is a simple game, where upon loading it a random number is given. The crystals are also assigned a random number, the goal is to have the user attempt to match the the number in their box, with the number in the random number box

- To make this game function I needed the random numbers to be assigned right as the page is loaded. A random number is assigned, and is output to the random number box.

- When clicking on the crystals, the value of that crystal will be added to the box containing your total number. 

- If the number in the user total box exceeds the number in the random number box, the user will bust and the game will tally a loss, and reset all values (including random number)

- Alternatively, if the user matches the random number perfectly, a win is tallied, and the game resets.
